# Kyverno + PostgreSQL RDS Testing - DETAILED TEST PLAN

## 🎯 **Test Objective**
Validate Kyverno policy enforcement, monitoring integration, and system performance using a **PROPER Controlled Load Testing** approach with PostgreSQL RDS storage.

## 🚀 **PROPER CONTROLLED LOAD TESTING METHODOLOGY**

### **Core Testing Principles:**
- **Scale up → wait 30s → scale down → wait 10s**
- **Maximum 10 pods running simultaneously**
- **Controlled resource usage and clean resource management**
- **Measurable performance metrics and admission webhook testing**

---

## **📋 TEST EXECUTION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup**
- **EKS Cluster**: Successfully created via Terraform (`alex-qa-reports-server`)
- **RDS PostgreSQL**: Successfully created and connected
- **Kyverno**: Successfully installed and configured
- **Reports Server**: Successfully connected to PostgreSQL RDS
- **Monitoring Stack**: Grafana + Prometheus operational

### **Phase 2: Object Deployment**
- **200 namespaces** created with required `owner=loadtest` labels
- **600 objects** deployed across 200 namespaces:
  - 200 ServiceAccounts (`demo-sa`)
  - 400 ConfigMaps (`cm-01`, `cm-02`)
- **200 deployments** created with zero replicas (ready for admission testing)
- **Total objects for Kyverno processing: 800**

### **Phase 3: PROPER Controlled Load Testing Execution**
- **20 batches processed** (10 namespaces per batch)
- **200 admission webhook events** triggered via deployment scaling
- **Resource management**: Maximum 10 pods running simultaneously
- **Controlled testing pattern**: Scale up → wait 30s → scale down → wait 10s

- **Clean Resource Management**: No orphaned pods or resource leaks
- **Repeatable Results**: Consistent batch processing enables reliable testing

### **Policy Compliance Requirements:**
- **`require-labels`**: All pods must have `app` and `version` labels
- **`disallow-privileged-containers`**: Must explicitly set `securityContext.privileged: false`
- **`require-ns-label-owner`**: All namespaces must have `owner` label

### **System Performance Insights:**
- **Kyverno Stability**: No pod restarts or errors during load testing
- **Admission Webhook Performance**: Consistent response times across all batches
- **Resource Cleanup**: Efficient pod termination and resource release
- **Policy Report Generation**: Real-time report creation during testing

## **🚀 NEXT STEPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Document Results**: Update test documentation with final metrics
