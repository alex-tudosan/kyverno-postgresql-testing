## 🧪 Phase 1: Foundation Setup

### Test Step 1.1: Policy Creation and Deployment

**What We're Doing:**
```bash
# Apply baseline policies
kubectl apply -f policies/baseline/require-labels.yaml
kubectl apply -f test-plan/policy-namespace-label.yaml
kubectl apply -f policies/baseline/disallow-privileged-containers.yaml
```

**Why We're Doing This:**
- Establish baseline policy rules that will generate PolicyReports
- Create predictable test conditions for validation
- Ensure policies are active before generating test data
- Deploy both pod-level and namespace-level policies for comprehensive testing

**Why It's Important:**
- Without active policies, no PolicyReports will be generated
- Baseline policies provide consistent test scenarios
- Validates that Kyverno can load and enforce policies correctly
- Namespace owner policy will generate PolicyReports for all test namespaces
- Pod labels policy will generate PolicyReports when we create deployments

**Expected Outcome:**
- Policies should be active and visible in `kubectl get clusterpolicies`
- No errors in Kyverno logs during policy loading
- Namespace owner policy will generate PolicyReports for namespaces without owner labels
- Pod labels policy will generate PolicyReports for pods without required labels

**✅ ACTUAL RESULTS:**
- All three policies deployed successfully
- Namespace label policy (`require-ns-label-owner`) actively enforced
- Policy enforcement verified: namespace creation blocked without proper labels
- Error message: "admission webhook 'validate.kyverno.svc-fail' denied the request"

### Test Step 1.2: System Health Validation

**What We're Doing:**
```bash
# Check Kyverno status
kubectl get pods -n kyverno
kubectl get pods -n reports-server

# Verify database connectivity
kubectl logs -n reports-server reports-server-7fdc7fdc49-5d9wj --tail=20
```

**Why We're Doing This:**
- Ensure all components are healthy before testing
- Verify database connectivity is established
- Confirm Reports Server is processing data correctly

**Why It's Important:**
- Prevents false test failures due to infrastructure issues
- Establishes baseline system state for comparison
- Validates that the monitoring setup is working

**Expected Outcome:**
- All Kyverno pods in Running state
- Reports Server pod healthy and connected to PostgreSQL
- No connection errors in logs

---

## 🏗️ Phase 2: Test Data Generation

### Test Step 2.1: Namespace Creation (Scale Preparation)

**What We're Doing:**
```bash
# Create test namespaces with required owner labels
for i in $(seq -w 1 200); do 
  kubectl create ns load-$i --labels=owner=loadtest
done
```

**Why We're Doing This:**
- Create many namespaces to test Kyverno's background scanning capability
- Generate PolicyReports without requiring running pods
- Prepare infrastructure for scale testing
- **IMPORTANT**: Namespaces must have owner labels to pass policy validation

**Why It's Important:**
- Kyverno's background controller scans all resources in all namespaces
- More namespaces = more objects to scan = more PolicyReports generated
- Tests the system's ability to handle large numbers of resources efficiently
- Validates that policy enforcement works correctly during namespace creation

**Expected Outcome:**
- 200 namespaces created successfully with owner=loadtest labels
- No PolicyReports generated for namespaces (they comply with policy)
- No significant performance degradation

**✅ ACTUAL RESULTS:**
- 200 namespaces created successfully with proper owner labels
- Policy enforcement working: namespace creation blocked without labels
- All namespaces compliant with namespace owner policy

### Test Step 2.2: Static Object Deployment

**What We're Doing:**
```bash
# Create objects.yaml with static resources
cat > objects.yaml <<'YAML'
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata: { name: demo-sa }
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata: { name: cm-01 }
data: { k: v }
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata: { name: cm-02 }
data: { k: v }
YAML

# Deploy to all namespaces
for i in $(seq -w 1 200); do 
  kubectl -n load-$i apply -f objects.yaml
done
```

**Why We're Doing This:**
- Create objects that Kyverno will scan in background mode
- Generate PolicyReports without consuming significant resources
- Test background scanning performance at scale

**Why It's Important:**
- Background scanning is a key Kyverno feature that processes existing resources
- Tests the Reports Server's ability to handle many concurrent report updates
- Validates that PostgreSQL can handle the write load from multiple namespaces

**Expected Outcome:**
- 600 objects created (3 per namespace × 200 namespaces)
- Background PolicyReports generated for each namespace
- Database shows increased report counts

**✅ ACTUAL RESULTS:**
- 600 objects deployed successfully across 200 namespaces:
  - 200 ServiceAccounts (demo-sa)
  - 400 ConfigMaps (cm-01, cm-02)
- Total objects for Kyverno processing: 800 (including 200 deployments from next step)

### Test Step 2.3: Deployment Preparation (Zero Replicas)

**What We're Doing:**
```bash
# Create deploy-zero.yaml
cat > deploy-zero.yaml <<'YAML'
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: { name: pause, labels: { app: pause } }
spec:
  replicas: 0
  selector: { matchLabels: { app: pause } }
  template:
    metadata: { labels: { app: pause } }
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pause
        image: registry.k8s.io/pause:3.9
        resources:
          requests: { cpu: "5m", memory: "16Mi" }
          limits:   { cpu: "30m", memory: "64Mi" }
YAML

# Deploy to all namespaces
for i in $(seq -w 1 200); do 
  kubectl -n load-$i apply -f deploy-zero.yaml
done
```

**Why We're Doing This:**
- Prepare deployments that can be quickly scaled up/down for admission testing
- Use minimal resource containers to stay within cluster capacity
- Create infrastructure for admission webhook testing

**Why It's Important:**
- Admission webhooks are triggered when resources are created/updated
- Zero-replica deployments allow testing admission without consuming resources
- Tests both admission and background scanning paths

**Expected Outcome:**
- 200 deployments created (0 replicas each)
- No pods running (0 total resource consumption)
- Deployments ready for admission testing

**✅ ACTUAL RESULTS:**
- 200 deployments created successfully with zero replicas
- No pods running (0 total resource consumption)
- Deployments ready for admission testing
- Total objects for Kyverno processing: 800 (600 static objects + 200 deployments)

---

## 🔄 Phase 3: Admission Testing (Batch Processing)

### Test Step 3.1: Batch Admission Testing

**What We're Doing:**
```bash
BATCH=10
for start in $(seq 1 $BATCH 200); do
  end=$((start+BATCH-1))
  
  # Scale up (trigger admission)
  for i in $(seq -w $start $end); do
    kubectl -n load-$i scale deploy/pause --replicas=1
  done
  
  # Wait for pods to be ready
  sleep 30
  
  # Scale down (free resources)
  for i in $(seq -w $start $end); do
    kubectl -n load-$i scale deploy/pause --replicas=0
  done
  
  # Wait for cleanup
  sleep 30
done
```

**Why It's Important:**
- Admission webhooks are the primary enforcement mechanism
- Tests real-time policy evaluation performance
- Validates that Reports Server can handle admission report bursts
- Simulates realistic workload patterns

**Expected Outcome:**
- 20 batches processed (200 namespaces ÷ 10 per batch)
- Admission PolicyReports generated for each scale-up
- No admission webhook timeouts or failures
- Consistent performance across batches

**✅ ACTUAL RESULTS:**
- 20 batches processed successfully (10 namespaces per batch)
- 200 admission webhook events triggered via deployment scaling
- Resource management: Maximum 10 pods running simultaneously
- Controlled testing: Scale up → wait 30s → scale down → wait 10s
- All admission events processed successfully with no timeouts or failures

### Test Step 3.2: Resource Churn Testing

**What We're Doing:**
```bash
# Add labels to trigger re-evaluation
for i in $(seq -w 1 200); do
  kubectl -n load-$i get pods -l app=pause -o name | \
